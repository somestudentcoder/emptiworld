# EmptiWorld
Empti World puts you in the shoes of Empti, a lonely life form trying to survive the effects of climate change on its planet. There does not seem to be any other life around anymore and so Empti tries to gather resources.  These resources then can be built into structures and tools that can help him survive the dangerous storms in summer and winter. Additionally he also needs to grow crops, so he won't starve in the process.

You can try the game on [itch.io](https://criticalclimate.itch.io/empti-world) or download our stable release in the release section.
